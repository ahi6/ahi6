## Hi there 👋

I'm a college student (1st semester as of Sept 2025). My public repositories mainly include projects I've done to improve my skill (or just for fun) in my spare time, but there's also my current NixOS configuration, which I aim to keep simple and straight to the point.

My favourite side project language is currently Rust, but I also know Javascript (+CSS, HTML; TS, Astro), Python and Dart.

Check out my [personal webpage](https://ahi.pages.dev) which I seldom update but which includes my projects as well as a little bit more info about me.

I can communicate in 🇨🇦English & 🇨🇿Czech well and I can undestand a bit of 🇩🇪German (roughly at CEFR B1+ level).
